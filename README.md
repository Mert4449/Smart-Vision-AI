## ⚡ Key Features

* **🧠 Multimodal Intelligence:** Processes **Visual** and **Auditory** data simultaneously using Gemini 2.0.
* **🗣️ Voice Interaction:** Talk to your camera! Ask *"What am I holding?"* or *"Describe the room"* and get instant audio responses.
* **🛡️ Clean Vision Logic:** Uses a sophisticated "Split-Frame" architecture. It displays UI overlays to the user but sends **raw, clean footage** to the AI for maximum accuracy.
* **👤 Face Tracking:** Real-time face detection with OpenCV integration.
* **🤖 Auto-Observer Mode:** When idle, the system automatically scans and describes the environment every 20 seconds.
